# GPT-OfficeHours

This project presents a chatbot fine-tuned on the wisdom of 
[Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html) and the YC community. 

Specifically, we use Paul Graham's essays, and transcripts from Y Combinator 
blog posts and YouTube videos to train a large language model. 

We will eventually put it together into a nice lil' web app.
